### 🖖 Hi there 👋 

<center><h1>Hi! I'm ND Robitaille</h1></center>
	<center> 🇺🇸 🇨🇦 👩‍🎓 ♀️ 👩‍👧‍👦 📔</center><br>
	
	
	🧭      I am a 🦕 who went to 🏫 for Instrumentation and Control Tech in 1️⃣9️⃣9️⃣9️⃣, but now I'm going back to finish with CS at 40.
          In addition, I'm also a sole-proprietor/freelancer (Est.2014) pursuing my love of writing, web accessibility, and technology. 
          Bad puns and sci-fi references are always encouraged.
          
	
	📆      Recently I was given the opportunity to finish my degree and work on some passion projects, so I'm participating in #100DaysOfCode and seeing how much I can   	
		learn outside of the classroom as well.
  
  
 🗨️      I'm learning, but I love to collaborate. Here's where you can find me:<br>
